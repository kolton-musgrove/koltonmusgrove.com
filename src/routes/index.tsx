          I'm a developer passionate about building complex, useful, and robust
          systems. The most meaningful work I do lies at the intersection of
          usability, performance, and complexity. I love to build things that
          are both beautiful and functional, and I'm always looking for new
          challenges to tackle.

          , where I help resolve real-time technical issues for clients. So far
          in my role I've worked with several teams to improve our triage
          process, reduce spend on third-party tools, and improve our developer
          experience.

          In the past, I've had the privilege to work with a small team of
          developers on a project in the

          industry. This project involved building a web application that allows
          users to book outdoor adventures, manage their reservations, and
          communicate with our team. I was responsible for improving the testing
          suite of the application, managing several significant refactors, and
          increasing observability of the system. I significantly improved our
          ability to surface and resolve issues in production, and I was able to
          reduce the number of issues in our backlog by more than 80% over the
          course of a few months.

          In college, I was able to work on several research projects including
          using machine learning to

          I have experience with a variety of technologies, including React,
          Remix, Node.js, Python, Go, and Rust. I'm always looking to learn new
          things and improve my skills. I enjoy working with teams to solve
          complex problems and build great products.

          In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, reading
          non-fiction, taking my dog Duke for long walks, and playing card
          games.
